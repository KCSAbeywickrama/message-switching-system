# message-switching-system

A device that can control and monitor household equipment via SMS. Short-code format was defined 
to give commands to accomplish those tasks. GPRS module was used to 
send and receive SMSs. Arduino was used as the main controller. This was my individual project, 
made to learn related technologies.
